A
Message
From
The
Headmaster
Kow
tow
!
That's
the
Chinese
for
"
hello
"
,
as
I've
learnt
this
week
,
because
those
were
the
first
words
said
to
me
by
the
Head
of
our
Chinese
sister
academy
,
the
Tiananmen
Not
At
All
Free
Schoo
.
As
you've
probably
gathered
,
we
were
rolling
out
the
school
"
red
"
(
!
)
carpet
this
week
for
Mr
Xi
Sho-pping
,
who
was
on
a
visit
to
try
and
buy
as
much
of
the
school
as
we
could
sell
hi
.
...
Mr
Sho-pping
then
visited
the
old
boiler
room
and
we
signed
an
agreement
for
him
to
build
not
only
a
new
nuclear
boiler
to
replace
it
,
but
to
build
another
two
boilers
,
just
in
case
the
other
one
blows
up
,
which
it
won't
of
cours
.
Even
better
,
all
the
boilers
will
be
run
entirely
by
himself
and
members
of
the
Beijing
Nuclear
Intelligence
Services
Department
,
who
are
delighted
to
be
the
given
the
chance
of
experimenting
with
untried
nuclear
technology
in
someone
else's
schoo
.
How
exciting
is
that
!
I
can't
have
been
the
only
one
to
feel
a
warm
glow
at
the
thought
of
so
much
radioactivity
at
the
very
heart
of
the
schoo
.
Who
knows
,
by
this
time
next
year
I
could
be
the
Two-head-master
!
