Precisely zero "United Kingdom corporation tax"
Osborne & Little reported a pre-tax profit of £722,000 on turnover of £34m and incurred a corporation
tax charge of £179,000. But the accounts for the year to March 2015 show it ended up paying precisely
zero "United Kingdom corporation tax" as the company was able to claim for "timing differences" from
previous years that offset the £179,000.
In fact, Osborne & Little has not had to pay any UK corporation tax for the last SEVEN years as it
has claimed variously for "capital allowances", "adjustments in respect of prior years" and historic losses
even as the company generated a total of over £200m in sales between April 2008 and March 2015.
Osborne & Little actually received a corporation tax credit of £12,000 in the year to March 2010, and the
last time it handed over any corporation tax was for the year ending March 2008. And some wonder why
the Treasury's coffers are running low!
